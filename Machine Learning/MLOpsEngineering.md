## Introduction to MLOps

* To implement quality control measures at the model registration step. If a model meets baseline performance metrics, it can be registered with a model registry. A model registry can be used as a quality gate. A model registry is a mechanism that is used to:
  * Catalog models for production.
  * Manage model versions.
  * Associate metadata, such as training metrics, with a model.
  * Manage the approval status of a model.
