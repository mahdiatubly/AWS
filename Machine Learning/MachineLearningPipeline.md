## Feature Engineering and Model Tuning
**Feature engineering:** is the science (and art) of extracting more information from existing data in order to improve your model’s prediction power and help your model learn faster.
**Dimensionality:** means the number of features (or inputs) you have in your data set. The phrase curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that models will have a difficult time finding the patterns you want them to identify when there are many different dimensions of data (many features) to sort through.

* Think of feature engineering as being made up of three similar, yet slightly different,
processes: • Feature extraction • Feature selection • Feature creation and transformation
