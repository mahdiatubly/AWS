## Feature Engineering and Model Tuning
**Feature engineering:** is the science (and art) of extracting more information from existing data in order to improve your model’s prediction power and help your model learn faster.

**Dimensionality:** means the number of features (or inputs) you have in your data set. The phrase curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that models will have a difficult time finding the patterns you want them to identify when there are many different dimensions of data (many features) to sort through.

* Think of feature engineering as being made up of three similar, yet slightly different,
processes:
    - Feature extraction:
    -         - In natural language processing: it could be extracting useful features like the most popular words from text that aren’t articles or prepositions.
    -         - With Structured data: Principal component analysis (PCA) or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (T-SNE)

    - Feature selection 
    - Feature creation and transformation
